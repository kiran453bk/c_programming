# C Programming Repository

This repository contains a structured collection of C programs organized topic-wise and week-wise.  
It covers fundamental language constructs, control structures, modular programming, recursion, file operations, and small system-based implementations.

The repository demonstrates practical implementation of core C concepts with clean, compilable source files.

-----------

### Structure Description

- **week1 – week8**  
  Progressive weekly implementations covering language fundamentals and structured programming techniques.

  ## Core Concepts Implemented

This repository includes implementations of:

### 1. Data Types and Variables
- Primitive data types
- Type modifiers
- Input/output operations using `scanf()` and `printf()`

### 2. Control Flow
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch`)
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Nested loops

### 3. Functions
- Function declaration and definition
- Parameter passing
- Return values
- Modular program structure

### 4. Arrays and Strings
- One-dimensional arrays
- Two-dimensional arrays
- String handling using:
  - `strlen()`
  - `strcpy()`
  - `strcmp()`
  - `strcat()`

### 5. Pointers
- Pointer declaration and initialization
- Pointer arithmetic
- Pointers with arrays
- Call by reference

### 6. Recursion
- Factorial computation
- Fibonacci sequence
- Recursive mathematical models
- Stack-based execution flow

### 7. File Handling
- File creation
- Reading and writing text files
- Appending data
- Structured file storage

### 8. Structured Programming
- Logical decomposition
- Menu-driven systems
- Modular code organization
- Simulation-based implementation

- **recursion/**  
  Programs demonstrating recursive function calls, stack behavior, and mathematical recursion models.

- **file handling/**  
  Programs implementing file operations using:
  - `fopen()`
  - `fclose()`
  - `fprintf()`
  - `fscanf()`
  - `fread()`
  - `fwrite()`

- **railway_seat_booing/**  
  A small simulation-based implementation demonstrating:
  - Structured data handling
  - Conditional logic
  - Menu-driven design
