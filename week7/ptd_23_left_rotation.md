## 🖥️ Code Explanation

- The program first takes the number of elements `n` as input.
- It then reads `n` integers into an array.
- Using a temporary variable, the first element is stored.
- All elements are shifted one position to the left.
- The stored element is placed at the end of the array.
- Finally, the rotated array is printed.
