# Program: Right Rotate Array by 1

## Description

This program performs a right rotation of an array by one position.

- The last element of the array is moved to the front.
- All other elements are shifted one position to the right.

## How It Works

1. User inputs the number of elements (`n`).
2. User enters `n` integers into the array.
3. The program stores the last element in a temporary variable.
4. Elements are shifted from right to left.
5. The temporary value is placed at the first index.
6. The rotated array is displayed.
